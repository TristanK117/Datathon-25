      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Seattle prides itself on providing the highest quality of care, understanding, and helpfulness to its community. As a result, its Customer Service Bureau has instituted infrastructure supporting various public services and avenues to request such services for Seattle’s residents.</p>
      <p>Taking data from the Bureau's Customer Service Requests web portal and “Find it, Fix it” mobile app, DataBang aims to turn these metrics into quantifiable results, insightfully illustrating the needs and wants of Seattle’s civil architecture and diverse residents. Managing these requests is crucial not only for the sake of efficient, quality problem-resolution, but also in response to the ever-increasing population of Seattle and the corresponding need for available public services.</p>
